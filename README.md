## QR Code Generator Website using Flasküêçüêç
This webapp created on Flask which can convert any url into a QR Code. The goal is to help out small businesses during Covid-19. By digitizing menus, customers will not need to share menus leading to less contamination. 

There are a number of QR generators online, which charge for dynamic codes which allow customers to track views and change the qr link. However, this is costly. instead, I decided to generate free static codes in python. Business can link to then link to a drive folder where they can update their menu anyways while keeping same link so basically avoiding the cost charged by these other providers.
The steps are simple, within a few minutes, you will have a QR code for your menu. 

I deployed this app on Google cloud so it is available to the public.
